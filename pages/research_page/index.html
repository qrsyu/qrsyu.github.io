            <h2>The splashback radius defines the boundary of a dark matter halo, where infalling dark matter particles 
                reach their first apocenter and turn around. By examining the distribution of the splashback radius 
                and the associated splashback features of dark matter halos, such as, the width and depth of the minimum 
                in the gradient profiles of dark matter halos in cosmological galaxy formation simulations IllustrisTNG 
                and MillenniumTNG. In short, the width of the gradient profile decreases with increasing halo mass and 
                redshift, indicating a sharper transition in more massive and older halos. Conversely, the depth of the 
                gradient profile increases with halo mass and remains relatively independent of redshift, suggesting 
                that more massive halos have more pronounced splashback features regardless of their formation epoch.

            <h2>Sleep has positive effects on memory consolidation, a critical process for learning 
                and cognitive function. By analyzing changes in both lower and higher-level visual 
                representations of episodic memories before and after sleep, we aim to understand how sleep 
                affects the retention and modification of visual and semantic information.

        <div class="subpage-right">
            <h2>The realm of dreams remains relatively uncharted due to the reliance of subjective 
                reports to access dream content. Building a dream decoding model is difficult due 
                to the difficulty in collecting large sample sizes of dream experience. We trained 
                an encoding model to generate EEG signals from deep neural network feature maps of 
                visual images viewed during waking, and used the model to try and predict EEG 
                signals collected during dreaming.
